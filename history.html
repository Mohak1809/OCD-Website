            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the History page of the Official OpenCode Developer Society (OCD) at NIT Kurukshetra. Our journey began as a vision of a dedicated student who saw the potential for creating a community of like-minded individuals passionate about coding, development, and problem-solving.</p>
            
            <div class="history">
                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>The OCD Society was founded by a visionary person who recognized the need for a dedicated platform where students could enhance their coding skills, collaborate on projects, and participate in competitive programming. With a clear goal of fostering a culture of learning and innovation, the society was established to bring together students with a shared passion for technology and development.</p>
                <p>Starting with a small group of enthusiastic members, the society began organizing coding sessions, online meets, and collaborative projects. The initial focus was on building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills among the members, and creating a supportive community for growth and learning.</p>

                <h3>Growth and Expansion</h3>
                <p>As word of the society's activities and success spread, more students were drawn to join. The society quickly grew from its humble beginnings into a dynamic community of over 400 members. This growth was driven by the society's commitment to excellence and its ability to offer valuable opportunities for personal and professional development.</p>
                <p>Over time, the society expanded its activities to include participation in hackathons, development of impactful projects, and active engagement in coding challenges. Each new member brought unique skills and perspectives, enriching the society and contributing to its ongoing success.</p>
                <p>Today, the OCD Society stands as a testament to the vision of its founder and the collective effort of its members. We continue to build on this legacy, striving to make a positive impact and support the growth of the coding community at NIT Kurukshetra.</p>
